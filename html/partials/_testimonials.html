          <p>"I just finished Q3 - landing at 486% attainment, delivering $4.17M against an $857K quota. This puts me at 252% attainment for the year! It's funny that we hardly talked about my deals, instead we spent our sessions focusing on mindset and habits. And that was enough to take me to the next level. I feel like a completely different person now than I was at the beginning of the year. Evolved, better, brighter and happier. Thank you for pushing me, encouraging me, and passing along your wisdom!"</p>

          <p>"When I started this program, I was in a new role and sitting at the very bottom of the leaderboard. Two quarters later—after going all in on the Untap Your Sales Potential Gold Program—I finished Q3 2025 as the #1 Mid-Market North America AE for bookings, hitting 220% of my target. This program, this community, and your coaching have truly transformed the way I sell and show up every day. When the results weren't immediate, you—this community—and my coach Christi reminded me to trust the process, keep putting in the work, and let the results follow. And they did. Ian, you are the best teacher. I'm grateful for the impact this program has had on me and so many others."</p>

          <p>"Ian, quick note of gratitude. Just finished my best sales year to date and closed my first 7-figure deal, both of which were goals at the beginning of the year. Being in UYSP gave me the confidence to think big and focusing on the process (not the outcome) helped me execute. Thank you."</p>
