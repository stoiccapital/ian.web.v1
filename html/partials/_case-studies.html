            "I just finished Q3—landing at 486% attainment, delivering $4.17M against an $857K quota.
            This puts me at 252% attainment for the year! It's funny that we hardly talked about my deals —
            instead, we focused on mindset and habits. That alone took me to the next level. I feel like a completely
            different person now: evolved, better, brighter, and happier. Thank you for pushing me, encouraging me,
            and passing along your wisdom!"

            Two quarters later—after going all in on the Untap Your Sales Potential Gold Program—I finished Q3 2025
            as the #1 Mid-Market North America AE for bookings, hitting 220% of my target. This program, this community,
            and your coaching have truly transformed the way I sell and show up every day. When the results weren't immediate,
            you—this community—and my coach Christi reminded me to trust the process, keep putting in the work, and let the results follow.
            And they did. Ian, you are the best teacher. I'm grateful for the impact this program has had on me and so many others."
